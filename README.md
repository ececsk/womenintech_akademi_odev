<summary><h4> 8- Find_Indexes_with_atotalof_Target</h4></summary>
The function should take an integer array of nums and a target target variable and return indexes whose sum is target.

Rules: We cannot use the value in the same index twice.

 Example-1 :
Parameters: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Return Value: [0,1]
Explanation: Since the values in nums[0] and nums[1] add up to 9, our output is [0, 1].

 Example-2:
Parameters: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Return Value: [1,2]
Explanation: Since the values in nums[1] and nums[2] add up to 6, our output is [1, 2].
Note: [0,0] cannot be accepted as output here. Because we were told that we cannot use the same index.

 Example-3:
Parameters: nums = [3,2,4,1,3], target = 7
Return Value: [2,4]
Explanation: Since the values in nums[2] and nums[4] add up to 7, our output is [2, 4].
